# Financial-Risk-Analysis-Management-Tail-Risk-Contagion-in-Green-Bond-Sectoral-Investment
This repository contains the code, datasets, and report for our research project on Tail Risk Contagion and Volatility Spillovers in global energy markets. The study investigates the interactions between green bonds, traditional energy sectors, and sectoral investments under extreme market conditions.

METHODOLOGY:
Data Collection: Acquired time-series data from international energy markets and green bond indices.
Modeling:
Used ARMA-EGARCH-Skew-t models to capture volatility dynamics.
Applied Quantile Vector Autoregression (QVAR) for spillover analysis across quantiles.
Analysis:
Investigated tail risk spillovers between traditional and clean energy markets.
Analyzed green bonds' role under market stress.


KEY FINDINGS:
Traditional energy sectors (e.g., S&P Energy Index) are major risk transmitters. Green bonds stabilize markets in downturns but are vulnerable in upswings. Long-term spillovers dominate due to structural and geopolitical factors. Tail risks behave asymmetrically in bearish vs. bullish markets.
Tail Risks Are State-Dependent: Spillover effects are amplified during extreme market states.
Long-Term Spillovers Dominate: Tail risk contagion is more pronounced over long-term horizons.
Asymmetric Spillover Behavior: Stronger asymmetry is observed in downside vs. upside shocks.
Traditional vs. Clean Energy:
Traditional energy markets are major risk senders.
Clean energy sectors (solar, geothermal, fuel cell) are risk receivers during market stress.


DATA SOURCES:
MSCI Green Bond Index
S&P Green Bond Index
S&P 500 Sector Indices (Energy, Financials, Industrials, Healthcare, Utilities, IT)
